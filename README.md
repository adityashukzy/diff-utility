# diff-utility
A diff utility written in C++ using a bottom-up implementation (i.e. tabulation) of the DP algorithm for the longest common subsequence problem.

The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences)
